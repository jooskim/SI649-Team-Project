We challenge all Kiva lenders to make one loan to a Kenyan entrepreneur in the name of this group to thank the tribe for their kindness and generosity during our time of grief.","description":"Kimeli Naiyomah, having witnessed 9\/11 firsthand in New York City and wanting in some way to alleviate America's grief, goes back to his Maasai tribe elders in Kenya and asks them to bless his only calf so that he can offer it to America as a gesture of consolation and support.. His tribe reacts by offering instead 14 blessed cows, a  most sacred and cherished gift.  Nine months later these 14 cows are presented to and accepted by the American embassy.\r\n\r\nThis lending group is named after the children's book \"14 Cows for America\" written by Carmen Agra Deedy which tells Kimeli's amazing and true story. \r\n","website_url":"","team_since":"2009-08-11T22:38:51Z","membership_type":"open","member_count":76,"loan_count":711,"loaned_amount":18625}]}
