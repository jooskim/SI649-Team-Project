We have no religious, racial or political affiliations of any kind. We want to encourage sustainable enterprises that recycle, reuse, repurpose and use environmentally sound agricultural and manufacturing practices. \r\nMany of us would like Kiva to develop environmental standards or criteria for their lending practices to prevent environmental impacts that would increase poverty for future generations.\r\nMany people want to have a green portfolio, or at least a green component. \r\nWon't you join us in creating true sustainability that includes a healthy environment?","website_url":"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/community\/viewTeam?team_id=231","team_since":"2008-08-30T18:31:44Z","membership_type":"open","member_count":1620,"loan_count":22072,"loaned_amount":627625}]}
