Teachers too often are among the most underpaid, undervalued but incalculably important members of our societies.   We want to support teachers in both their private and professional endeavors as a way of expressing our terrific appreciation for the work that they do and the near infinite ways they give of themselves to our children.","description":"We are teachers, former teachers, volunteer teachers, current or former students of teachers, or simply, admirers and valuers of teachers.   We have in common that every one of us can think of at least one teacher in our lives who profoundly touched us or comforted us or inspired us or otherwise affected the ways our minds were expanded or our hearts nourished.  We deeply believe in compassion and sharing and kindness and empathy and community, and we profoundly understand that those qualities don\u2019t evolve automatically in our youth but have to be taught.\r\n\r\n","website_url":"","team_since":"2009-06-03T23:43:10Z","membership_type":"open","member_count":113,"loan_count":1816,"loaned_amount":48400}]}
