We are hoping that by helping other mother's we will be helping the next generation of children to know that each person counts and everyone deserves a chance to live a happy, healthy, peaceful life. Women all over the world care about one another and when you help a woman, you help her entire community!","description":"We are women from all walks of life, from all over the world.  We are moms, professionals, business owners, teachers, artists, doctors, nurses, yoga teachers, doulas, executives, police officers, singers, wives, farmers, lawyers, you name it we do it.  We care about our world, we care about our earth and we care about our children and our families.  And we know there are women who do not have the opportunities we have and we'd like to even the playing field a bit by showing our support with these loans, knowing that we are all part of the greater human family, of which every person is an integral part.  It is a small world after all.","website_url":"coming soon","team_since":"2008-09-30T22:55:38Z","membership_type":"open","member_count":14,"loan_count":163,"loaned_amount":4100}]}
