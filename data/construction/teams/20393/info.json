Like slavery and apartheid. it is man made and can be removed by the actions of human beings.\" - Nelson Mandela\r\n\r\nWe believe in empowering the individual because faith without works is dead. \"He who is kind to the poor lends to the Lord and he will repay him for his deed.\" Proverbs 19:17. \r\n\r\nWe loan because giving makes us happy and shifts our energy into a receptive mode.
