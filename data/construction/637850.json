This team is about making that money work \u2013 by shifting excess unused capital from your household into Kiva, you can help others while staying financially secure!\r\n\r\nKeeping a high balance in your checking\/savings account is unnecessary for many people. The interest you earn on this amount, even in high-yield savings, usually won\u2019t even top $100 on $10,000 in one year. How many Kiva entrepreneurs could you help with that money? (Answer: up to 400!)\r\n\r\nShift some of that redundant money to Kiva and help alleviate poverty!\r\n\r\nNotes: Since this money is being shifted from funds that you are somewhat used to having at your disposition, it is important that you are selective with your loans. You can loan to whoever you want, but it\u2019s prudent to have this money available in a reasonable amount of time. Remember, you cannot get money from Kiva back immediately; you have to wait for repayments. That\u2019s why we recommend investing in short-term loans of 5 or 6 months (so your repayments come in quickly and you can recoup all of your capital within half a year), spreading loans across multiple entrepreneurs\/field partners (\u201cdiversifying\u201d your loans to mitigate risk), and choosing field partners that have at least a 3-star rating (higher ratings means less delinquent\/defaulted loans). Following these rules minimizes the risk inherent in loaning on Kiva.
