It just takes one small step by each of us lending on kiva. Together we can make it easier for hard working people to get the much-needed capital to sustain and grow their business. We feel blessed to be able to support the aspirations of so many loan recipients who persevere tenaciously for a better quality of life with dignity. Kudos to Kiva.org that allows us to connect for this common cause.","description":"In our team, we have a vision to change lives in novel ways. Our team's origin began with a Kiva Card (gift certificate) whose recipient founded this team. Inspired by Kiva Fellow, Jessica Heinzelman's talk, our founder dreamed to take us on a cruise, beyond the realm of lending targets and team statistics. Frequent &amp; occasional lenders are free to choose who to lend to, how much and when in an amiable team ambience nurtured by Kiva Fellows, Kiva Editor &amp; Translators, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, workers, retired people, families, parent + kid(s), students, teachers, and professionals. Our diversity &amp; portfolio enable our discovery of social values inherent in the Kiva micro-lending ecosystem whose issues we debate objectively. Experienced members are gratified to enhance our grasp of nuances in lending. We wish to work with volunteers in the team, Kiva Friends, http:\/\/kivafriends.org and our supporters to engage in activities that promote Kiva. Our journey to strengthen and grow the Kiva ecosystem has room for more. JOIN NOW, and check out our team, to convince yourself that it can be your team too.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO SEE ALSO:\r\n1.
