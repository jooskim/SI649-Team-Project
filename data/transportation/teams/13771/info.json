We transferred company shares to the foundation with the philosophy that we should not forget the world around us if we had success. We achieved great success and when the company was sold to Nokia the foundation sold its shares.\r\n\r\nWe are a non-profit charitable foundation and aim to help people in developing countries. We think Kiva is a great way to achieve this.","website_url":"http:\/\/www.kiva.org\/lender\/trolltech4460","team_since":"2010-05-31T21:12:06Z","membership_type":"closed","member_count":1,"loan_count":75309,"loaned_amount":1882725}]}
