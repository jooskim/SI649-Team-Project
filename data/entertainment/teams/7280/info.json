Then I visited a bunch of clients, who were amazing, and I've written a book about it called \"The International Bank of Bob\" (Walker\/Bloomsbury, March 5, 2013).\r\n\r\nI hope the book will get more people to feel a greater understanding of Kiva, a better appreciation of the role of microfinance, and most of all, more connected to the rest of the world.\r\n","description":"People who realize that if we switched places with the recipients, they'd loan to us just as happily.
